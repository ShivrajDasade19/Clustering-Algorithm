        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This project applies clustering algorithms such as K-Means,
            Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to analyze student performance data.
            The dataset is grouped into three clusters: Excellent Students,
            Average Students, and At-Risk Students.
            The objective is to discover hidden patterns and classify students
            based on academic performance without predefined labels.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group
            similar data points together. In this project, student performance data
            is analyzed using clustering algorithms to identify patterns in academic
            behavior. The main goal is to segment students based on grades, study time,
            absences, and academic records.

        <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset used is the Student Performance Dataset obtained from
            the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains academic,
            demographic, and social attributes of students from Portuguese schools.

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>

        <h3>1. K-Means Clustering</h3>
        <p>
            K-Means partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the distance
            between data points and cluster centroids.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Hierarchical Clustering</h3>
        <p>
            Hierarchical clustering builds clusters in a tree-like structure
            using a dendrogram to visualize cluster formation.
        </p>

        <h3>3. DBSCAN</h3>
        <p>
            DBSCAN groups data points based on density and identifies noise
            or outliers effectively.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset was successfully divided into three clusters:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cluster 1:</strong> Excellent Students</li>
            <li><strong>Cluster 2:</strong> Average Students</li>
            <li><strong>Cluster 3:</strong> At-Risk Students</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These clusters help educators identify performance levels and
            provide targeted academic support.
        </p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates how clustering algorithms can effectively
            classify student performance data into meaningful groups. The results
            provide valuable insights that can assist educational institutions in
            improving academic strategies and student support systems.
